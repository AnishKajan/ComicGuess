# Requirements Document

## Introduction

ComicGuess is a daily Wordle-style puzzle web application where users guess comic book characters from three different universes: Marvel, DC, and Image Comics. The application provides a new puzzle each day for each universe, tracks user statistics and streaks, and features universe-specific theming. Users can guess character names and receive immediate feedback, with successful guesses revealing the character's image.

The scope of ComicGuess is limited to daily character puzzles from Marvel, DC, and Image universes, with streak tracking and image reveal. It does not include comics trivia beyond character name guessing.
