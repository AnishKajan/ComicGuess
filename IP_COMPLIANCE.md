- **Rights Holder**: Marvel Entertainment, LLC (owned by The Walt Disney Company)
- **Trademark Status**: Marvel owns trademarks on major character names including but not limited to:
  - Spider-Man, Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, X-Men, Fantastic Four
  - Character names are generally trademarked for entertainment and merchandise use
- **Usage Considerations**: Character names used in educational/trivia context may qualify for fair use

- **Trademark Status**: DC owns trademarks on major character names including but not limited to:
  - Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Green Lantern, Aquaman
  - Character names are generally trademarked for entertainment and merchandise use
- **Usage Considerations**: Character names used in educational/trivia context may qualify for fair use

#### Image Comics
- **Rights Holder**: Image Comics, Inc. and individual creators
- **Trademark Status**: Various creators own rights to characters including:
  - Spawn (Todd McFarlane), The Walking Dead characters (Robert Kirkman), Saga characters (Brian K. Vaughan/Fiona Staples)
- **Usage Considerations**: More complex ownership structure with creator-owned properties

### Character Images and Copyrights

#### Visual Representations
- **Copyright Status**: Character visual designs are protected by copyright
- **Rights Holders**: Same as trademark holders above
- **Usage Restrictions**: Reproduction of character images requires licensing or fair use justification

## Fair Use Analysis

### Educational and Transformative Use
ComicGuess may qualify for fair use protection under the following factors:

#### Factor 1: Purpose and Character of Use
- **Educational Purpose**: Game serves educational function by testing knowledge of comic book characters
- **Non-Commercial Nature**: If operated as free educational tool without direct monetization
- **Transformative Use**: Character names/images used in new context (puzzle game) rather than original entertainment context

#### Factor 2: Nature of Copyrighted Work
- **Published Works**: All characters are from published, widely distributed works
- **Fictional Characters**: Characters are creative fictional works deserving strong protection

#### Factor 3: Amount and Substantiality
- **Limited Use**: Only character names and single representative images used
- **Not Substantial Portion**: Individual characters represent small fraction of overall comic universes

#### Factor 4: Effect on Market
- **No Market Substitution**: Puzzle game does not substitute for comic books or official merchandise
- **Potential Positive Effect**: May increase interest in comic book properties

## Licensing Posture and Recommendations

### Current Approach: Fair Use Reliance
ComicGuess currently operates under a fair use theory based on:
1. Educational/trivia purpose
2. Transformative use in puzzle context
3. Limited use of character names and single images
4. No direct monetization of character IP

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

1. **Attribution Implementation**: Add proper attribution for all character images and names
2. **Educational Disclaimer**: Clearly state educational/trivia purpose
3. **Non-Commercial Operation**: Avoid direct monetization of character content
4. **Limited Use Policy**: Use only single representative image per character

#### Medium-Term Considerations
1. **Legal Review**: Obtain formal legal opinion on fair use position
2. **Licensing Exploration**: Investigate licensing opportunities with rights holders
3. **Alternative Content**: Develop original characters or public domain alternatives
4. **Insurance**: Consider intellectual property liability insurance

#### Long-Term Strategy
1. **Formal Licensing**: Pursue licensing agreements if service becomes commercially successful
2. **Partnership Opportunities**: Explore partnerships with comic publishers
3. **Original Content Development**: Create original puzzle content to reduce IP dependency

## Content Attribution System

### Implementation Requirements

#### Character Image Attribution
All character images must include:
- Character name
- Rights holder (Marvel Comics, DC Comics, Image Comics, etc.)
- Copyright notice
- "Used under fair use for educational purposes" disclaimer

#### Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- Add attribution fields to puzzle table
ALTER TABLE puzzles ADD COLUMN rights_holder VARCHAR(100);
ALTER TABLE puzzles ADD COLUMN copyright_notice VARCHAR(200);
ALTER TABLE puzzles ADD COLUMN attribution_text TEXT;
```

#### Frontend Display Requirements

## Content Governance and Validation
